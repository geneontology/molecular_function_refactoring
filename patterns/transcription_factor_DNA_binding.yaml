# General rules for naming: 
### transcription factor activity
### RNA polymerase II transcription factor activity
### RNA polymerase II transcription factor activity, 
### transcriptional activator activity, RNA polymerase II core promoter proximal region sequence-specific binding
### In this last one, the initial mention of RNA polymerase II is dropped as redundant 
### with its mention in the DNA binding clause.  This is obviously hard to support with automatic naming.
