# Molecular Function Refactoring

## MF refactoring aims:

- Clarify the definition of molecular function and its major subdivisions
- Add new intermediate nodes that provide biologically meaningful and useful ways for biologists to group functions 
- Allow new term to allow curators to better capture the compound nature of functions
- Automate classification via the implementation of design patterns
- Add error checking in the form of disjointeness axioms
- Provide templates and automated inference to simplify and standardise LEGO curation

See [overview](overview.md) for background and details.
